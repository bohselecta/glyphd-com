# 🧩 Glyphd — Revised Product Brief
> **Make your mark.**

---

## 🌐 Core Concept

**Glyphd** is an **AI-powered creative build studio** that turns a single idea prompt into a complete, shareable product — a **Mark.**

A **Mark** is a self-contained project composed of:
- Visual identity (hero image + logo)
- Generated copy and structure
- Schema-driven metadata (Product, Service, CreativeWork, etc.)
- JSON-LD for SEO and discoverability
- Shareable preview link
- Exportable as static site or Next.js app

**"Make your mark"** — because a glyph is any mark or symbol.  
*"Cool idea! Go make a mark on glyphd and send it to me to check out later."*

Everything from **idea → image → share** happens in one seamless interface.

## 💎 Product Positioning

Glyphd competes with app builders like **Floot**, **Puter**, and **Bolt.new**,  
but emphasizes:
- **True ownership** — export and leave anytime, no lock-in
- **Full creative control** — designer-driven schema editing
- **Shareable preview links** — no deployment friction
- **Rich aesthetic control** via brand tokens
- **Pay-per-use simplicity** — GLM-based z.ai pricing model
