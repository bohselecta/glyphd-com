# Reset Options

## Current Issues
- Vercel deployment configuration is complex
- Local coding agent may have issues
- Auth system added complexity

## Option 1: Complete Rollback (Clean Start)
Roll back to commit before auth/supabase changes:
```bash
git reset --hard c8a73d4  # Before Supabase auth
```
**Pros:** Clean slate, everything worked before
**Cons:** Lose recent UI improvements (backgrounds, button icons)

## Option 2: Keep UI, Remove Auth
Keep recent UI changes but disable authentication:
```bash
# Nothing needed - auth is already disabled by default
```
The auth system is disabled for demo mode already.

## Option 3: Simple Vercel Fix
Just remove all Vercel complexity:
- Delete vercel.json at root
- Deploy normally without special config
- Or use Netlify/Railway instead

## Option 4: Test Locally Only
Don't deploy yet, just make local work:
- All changes work locally
- Demo mode works without database
- Fix any local issues first

## Recommended: Option 4
Test locally first, then worry about deployment later.
