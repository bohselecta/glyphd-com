## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Blocking Vercel

**The issues are deployment-specific, not code issues:**

1. **Private GitHub Repo** - Vercel can't access it
   - Solution: Make repo public OR configure Vercel GitHub app permissions

2. **Root Directory** - Needs to be set in Vercel dashboard
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí General
   - Set "Root Directory" to `apps/web`

3. **Environment Variables** - Need to be added in Vercel
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `IMAGE_GEN_API_KEY`
   - `ZAI_API_KEY`

## üéØ Your Options

### Option 1: Test Locally (Recommended for now)
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:5173
# Use demo mode to test everything
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (When ready)
1. Make GitHub repo public (easiest)
2. OR configure Vercel GitHub app for private repos
3. Set root directory to `apps/web` in Vercel dashboard
4. Add environment variables
5. Redeploy

### Option 3: Use Different Platform
- Railway, Render, or Netlify might be simpler
- Just need to set root directory and env vars

## üìù What You Have Right Now

- ‚úÖ Working app locally
- ‚úÖ Auth system ready (demo mode works)
- ‚úÖ All UI improvements
- ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ Deployment blocked by GitHub permissions and Vercel config

**Your code is good. It's just a deployment configuration issue.**
